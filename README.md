### Description

The README Generator is a command-line application that allows users to easily create professional and high-quality README files for their projects. This application streamlines the process of generating READMEs by providing a series of questions and automatically formatting the responses into a README markdown file.

### Usage

After running the application, you will be prompted with a series of questions related to your project. These questions will cover various aspects of your project, such as its title, description, installation instructions, usage, chosen license, contributing guidelines, and information about running tests. Additionally, you will be asked for your GitHub username and email address for contact.

The application will generate a README file named "README.md" in the same directory. This file will contain the formatted information you provided in response to the questions.
